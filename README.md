# Bot_for_86guy
Bot ordered by 86guy

Bot is made for 86guy on MIT license
To run it you will need
Node v15.5.1
Discord.js (12.5.1)


You also need to create config.json file that will look like this one:
{
    "token": "Your token will go here",
    "niggalist": ["list", "of", "bad", "words", "seperated", "like", "this"],
    "channel_id": "Id of channel that bot will send message to"
}


First you must npm init and confirm all
Second you just need to run node index.js (while beeing in directory of files)
Everything should work fine

For any questions and any other ideas just dont hestitate to contact with me
